        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Messagram mobile application ("App") operated by Code Hospital ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        
        <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>
        
        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

        <h3>Use of the App</h3>
        
        <p>Messagram is an application that forwards SMS messages from your device to your Telegram account. By using the App, you understand and agree that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any login information associated with your use of the App.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account or device.</li>
            <li>You must not use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>You must not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or hack the App, or defeat or overcome any technology, encryption, or security measures implemented in the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Permissions and Access</h3>
        
        <p>To function properly, Messagram requires certain permissions on your device, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Access to SMS messages to forward them to Telegram</li>
            <li>Access to contacts (optional) to display contact names instead of phone numbers</li>
            <li>Access to phone state to identify SIM cards and carriers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By using the App, you grant us these permissions. You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, but doing so may limit or disable certain features of the App.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        
        <p>The App integrates with Telegram's services to forward your SMS messages. Your use of Telegram's services is subject to Telegram's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for any third-party services, including Telegram.</p>
        
        <p>The App may also contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Code Hospital. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.</p>

        <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
        
        <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Code Hospital and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.</p>
        
        <p>Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Code Hospital.</p>

        <h3>Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
        
        <p>Your use of the App is at your sole risk. The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The App is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
        
        <p>Code Hospital does not warrant that a) the App will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the App is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the App will meet your requirements.</p>

        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        
        <p>In no event shall Code Hospital, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>

        <h3>Termination</h3>
        
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
        
        <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        
        <p>By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>
