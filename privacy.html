        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Code Hospital ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by Code Hospital when you use our Messagram mobile application ("App").</p>
        
        <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        
        <p>We collect several types of information from and about users of our App:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> The primary function of Messagram is to forward your SMS messages to your Telegram account. To provide this service, we need to access and process the SMS messages you receive on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you grant the App permission to access your contacts, we will use this information to display contact names instead of phone numbers when forwarding messages.</li>

            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> When you use the App, we automatically collect certain information, including the time and date of your actions, device information, and app crashes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Provide the core functionality of the App: forwarding SMS messages to your Telegram account</li>

        <h3>Data Storage and Transfer</h3>

        <p>However, to facilitate the connection between your device and Telegram, we store a unique connection code that links your device to your Telegram account. This code does not contain any personal information and is used solely for establishing the connection.</p>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Telegram:</strong> SMS messages are forwarded to Telegram through their official bot API. Please refer to Telegram's privacy policy for information on how they handle your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may employ third-party companies to facilitate our service, provide the service on our behalf, perform service-related tasks, or assist us in analyzing how our service is used. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of your personal information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:</p>
